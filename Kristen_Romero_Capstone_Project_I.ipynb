    "**Question to answer**: What is the percentage of students from a California high school that will meet UC/CSU entrance requirements by the time they graduate? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected data source:**\n",
    "The data that will be used is sourced from California's Department of Education (CDE) website. Data on public school type (i.e., charter/magnet/year-round/virtual/etc.), and the city the public school is in will be used to predict the percentage of students in a California high school meeting UC/CSU requirements. Because these information is uploaded separately on the CDE website, the most recent year that is reported for all data categories is the 2016-2017 school year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technique expected to be used in your analysis:**\n",
    "Linear regression would be the most appropriate technique to use in this machine learning problem rather than classification techniques such as logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, and support vector machines."

    "### Summary:\n",
    "In part I of the capstone project, I attempted to predict the percentage of students from each California high school who are UC/CSU-ready. The features I looked into were: public school type (i.e., charter/magnet/year-round/virtual/etc.), and the city the public school is in. Because all this data were spread out into different datasets, the first part of this assignment (section 2) was devoted to cleaning the data from the  California's Department of Education (CDE) website and merging the different datasets into one dataframe. I fitted the linear regression model to this dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The training and test mse's are relatively similar indicating that the model's predictablility among the training set is very similar to that of the test set. However, the model's accuracy is relatively low. Perhaps more features should be included and/or an ensemble model should be used instead. I will learn more about ensemble models in the next module."
