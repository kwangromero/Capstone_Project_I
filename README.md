# Capstone_Project_I
Predicting the % of 12th graders in CA high schools who are UC/CSU-ready

# Summary:
In part I of the capstone project, I attempted to predict the percentage of students from each California high school who are UC/CSU-ready. The features I looked into 
were: public school type (i.e., charter/magnet/year-round/virtual/etc.), and the city the public school is in. Because all this data were spread out into different 
datasets, the first part of this assignment (section 2) was devoted to cleaning the data from the California's Department of Education (CDE) website and merging the 
different datasets into one dataframe. I fitted the linear regression model to this dataframe.

# Conclusion:
The training and test mse's are relatively similar indicating that the model's predictablility among the training set is very similar to that of the test set. However, 
the model's accuracy is relatively low. Perhaps more features should be included and/or an ensemble model should be used instead. I will learn more about ensemble models 
in the next module.
